# PersonalProjectsDump
A collection of short / long personal projects I've done in my spare time for fun.

### Pygame Projects
In Pygame projects you'll find some game "challenges" i've made myself.
Usually what'll happen is I'll think back to a game I've played and I think to myself:
"Bet that wouldn't be too difficult to code".
Usually that ends up with me catastrophically making a fool out of myself,
however I do learn something so I suppose there is merit to the idea.
Currently Pygame Projects include two games:
1. AgarBootleg
2. VoidClickerGame

AgarBootleg is exactly what it sounds like, it's an agar.io "clone". The basic
functionality of the game wasn't too difficult to produce but I'm still working on smoother
movements and the splitting of the "blob" or "Cell" if you will.

VoidClickerGame was at first an attempt at cloning the game "Cookie Clicker" which wouldn't
be too difficult, but in the process of thinking of ways to animate the "Cookie's" radius getting
smaller and then returning to its normal size when you click on it, I got the idea to instead make
the goal of the game to click the "void" in order to keep it from growing too large and taking over the universe I guess.
